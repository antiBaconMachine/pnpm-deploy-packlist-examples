# Deploy packlist examples

Simple repo designed to validate the various methods of packlist generation that pnpm deploy uses.

This likely all comes from https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-packlist but I'm not familiar enough with the pnpm source code to say for sure, it was faster for me to write these test cases than grok the repo.

In this first example we have an explicit files field which includes only the file `eggs` and an .npmignore which excludes `eggs`

```
pnpm deploy --filter files  /tmp/dist && ls  /tmp/dist                                                        ─╯
eggs  package.json
```

In this example we have an .npmignore file which excludes `eggs` and a .gitignore which excludes `spam`. The `spam` file is generated by preinstall hook as it can't be commited because of the `.gitignore`

```
pnpm i && pnpm deploy --filter npmignore  /tmp/dist && ls  /tmp/dist                                              ─╯
package.json  spam
```

Lastly we have a `.gitgnore` which excludes spam

```
pnpm i && pnpm deploy --filter gitignore  /tmp/dist && ls  /tmp/dist                                          ─╯
eggs  package.json
```
